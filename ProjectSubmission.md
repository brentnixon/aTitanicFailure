### Summary:
This Tableau story is a simple exploration of the loss of the ocean-going vessel Titanic through a publicly available dataset that contains information about passenger numbers, age, sex, socioeconomic class, and other variables, as well as whether or not they survived the event. My story explores the breakdown of passengers across these different variables. Once the makeup of the ship's passengers is more clear, I explore the breakdown of passenger survival across the same variables.

### Feedback:
- the blue color for every chart is somewhat boring
- the titles of the different graphics in the dashboards are not very clear
- the axes of the different graphics need to be re-worded more clearly
- some of the charts could have their data / ink ratio improved

### Design:
* Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

- re-titled the charts in each dashboard for a clear, concise explanation
- re-worded the axis labels and label positions of the charts for simplicity and clarity
- changed the aliases of the socioeconomic classes to upper, middle, and lower instead of 1,2,3
- renamed several of the variables to more meaningful names
- removed grid lines where useful
- replaced axis tick labels with measure labels on bars
- consolidated two survival charts by adding percentage and absolute figures to each bar on one chart
- added percentage and number labels to multiple bars and chart sections
- changed bar charts of age group and socio-economic class to bubble and block charts, respectively
