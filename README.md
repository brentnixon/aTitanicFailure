### Summary:
This Tableau story is a simple exploration of the loss of the ocean-going vessel Titanic through a publicly available dataset that contains information about passenger numbers, age, sex, socioeconomic class, and other variables, as well as whether or not they survived the event. My story explores the breakdown of passengers across these different variables. Once the makeup of the ship's passengers is more clear, I explore the breakdown of passenger survival across the same variables.
